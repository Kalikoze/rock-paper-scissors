## Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is my first attempt at creating a rock paper scissors game using Python. It's a simple game where the player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and competes against the computer. The computer's choice is determined randomly.

I used basic Python concepts such as conditional statements and random number generation to implement the game logic. It was a fun and educational experience for me as a beginner in Python programming.

Feel free to check out the code and give it a try! Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome.
